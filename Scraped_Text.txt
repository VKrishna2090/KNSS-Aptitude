This set of Computer Networks Multiple Choice Questions & Answers (MCQs) focuses on “Reference Models – 2”.
1. OSI stands for __________
a) open system interconnection
b) operating system interface
c) optical service implementation
d) open service Internet
View Answer Answer: a
Explanation: OSI is the abbreviation for Open System Interconnection. OSI model provides a structured plan on how applications communicate over a network, which also helps us to have a structured plan for troubleshooting. It is recognized by the ISO as the generalized model for computer network i.e. it can be modified to design any kind of computer network.

2. The number of layers in ISO OSI reference model is __________
a) 4
b) 5
c) 6
d) 7
View Answer Answer: d
Explanation: In OSI reference model, there are 7 layers namely Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link and Physical layer. Each layer uses a protocol to perform its designated function, for example, the data link layer uses error detection protocols for error control functions.

3. TCP/IP model does not have ______ layer but OSI model have this layer.
a) session layer
b) transport layer
c) application layer
d) network layer
View Answer Answer: a
Explanation: In OSI reference model, there are two layers which are not present in TCP/IP model. They are Presentation and Session layer. The functions of Presentation and Session layer in the OSI model are handled by the transport layer itself in TCP/IP.

4. Which layer is used to link the network support layers and user support layers?
a) session layer
b) data link layer
c) transport layer
d) network layer
View Answer Answer: c
Explanation: Physical, data link and network layers are network support layers and session, presentation and application layers are user support layers. The transport layer links these layers by segmenting and rearranging the data. It uses protocols like TCP and UDP.

5. Which address is used on the internet for employing the TCP/IP protocols?
a) physical address and logical address
b) port address
c) specific address
d) all of the mentioned
View Answer Answer: d
Explanation: The physical, logical, port and specific addresses are used in TCP/IP protocol. All the addressing schemes, that is physical (MAC) and logical address, port address and specific address are employed in both TCP/IP model and OSI model. In TCP/IP, the addresses are more focused on the internet implementation of these addresses.

6. TCP/IP model was developed _____ the OSI model.
a) prior to
b) after
c) simultaneous to
d) with no link to
View Answer Answer: a
Explanation: Several TCP/IP prototypes were developed at multiple research centers between 1978 and 1983, whereas OSI reference model was developed in the year 1984. TCP/IP was developed with the intention to create a model for the Internet while OSI was intended to be a general network model.

7. Which layer is responsible for process to process delivery in a general network model?
a) network layer
b) transport layer
c) session layer
d) data link layer
View Answer Answer: b
Explanation: The role of Transport layer (Layer 4) is to establish a logical end to end connection between two systems in a network. The protocols used in Transport layer is TCP and UDP. The transport layer is responsible for segmentation of the data. It uses ports for the implementation of process-to-process delivery.

8. Which address is used to identify a process on a host by the transport layer?
a) physical address
b) logical address
c) port address
d) specific address
View Answer Answer: c
Explanation: A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. Some examples of port numbers are port 20 which is used for FTP data, port 22 which is used for SSH remote login ,and port 23 which is used for TELNET.

9. Which layer provides the services to user?
a) application layer
b) session layer
c) presentation layer
d) physical layer
View Answer Answer: a
Explanation: In networking, a user mainly interacts with application layer to create and send information to other computer or network. Application layer provides the interface between applications and the network. It is the top-most layer in both the TCP/IP and the OSI model.

10. Transmission data rate is decided by ____________
a) network layer
b) physical layer
c) data link layer
d) transport layer
View Answer Answer: b
Explanation: Physical layer is a layer 1 device which deals with network cables or the standards in use like connectors, pins, electric current used etc. Basically the transmission speed is determined by the cables and connectors used. Hence it is physical layer that determines the transmission speed in network. Some of the cables used for high speed data transmission are optical fiber cables and twisted pair cables.
